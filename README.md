## 🧠 About Me

I'm a back-end developer focused on building **secure and well-structured applications**. My main stack revolves around **Java and Spring Boot**, where I design **REST APIs** with attention to clean architecture, maintainability, and **security by design**.

I'm particularly interested in **application security (AppSec)** and in understanding how vulnerabilities emerge in real systems — from authentication flaws to improper access control and misconfigurations. I approach software development as an **engineering discipline**, where clarity, security, and system behavior matter more than frameworks alone.
