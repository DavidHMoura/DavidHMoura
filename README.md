## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineering student** with a strong focus on **back-end development** and **secure application design**. My main stack revolves around **Java and Spring Boot**, where I build APIs emphasizing clean architecture, maintainability, and security by design.

I’m particularly interested in how systems fail under attack — from authentication flaws to improper access control and misconfigured services. My studies include **cybersecurity fundamentals, networking, hardware hacking concepts, and offensive security**, always aiming to understand how vulnerabilities arise and how to mitigate them at the engineering level.

I see software development as an engineering discipline: code clarity, security, and system behavior matter more than frameworks alone.
