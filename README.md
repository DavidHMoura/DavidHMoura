## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Software Engineer** with a deep passion for building robust, scalable, and inherently secure backend systems. My expertise lies at the intersection of **Backend Development** and **Application Security (AppSec)**, where I focus on crafting solutions that not only perform efficiently but also stand resilient against modern threats.

With a strong foundation in **Java** and **Spring Boot**, I specialize in designing architectures that prioritize **Zero Trust principles**, **stateless security**, and **data integrity**. I am committed to engineering excellence, advocating for clean code, pragmatic design, and a security-first mindset throughout the software development lifecycle.

## ✨ Featured Projects

Here are some of my key open-source contributions, showcasing my approach to secure and performant backend engineering:

### 🛡️ [Compliance Risk Engine](https://github.com/DavidHMoura/compliance-risk-engine)

> **Venture-grade background engine for automated compliance monitoring, liability risk mitigation, and target-company data extraction.**

A headless, event-driven daemon built with **Java 21 (Virtual Threads)** and **Spring Boot 3**, leveraging **Playwright** for secure data extraction from government portals. This project exemplifies **Zero Attack Surface** design, multi-tenant data isolation, and immutable cryptographic audit logging, ensuring high integrity for critical compliance operations.

### 🔐 [Secure Auth API](https://github.com/DavidHMoura/secure-auth-api)

> **Production-grade authentication and authorization API built with Spring Boot and Spring Security, focusing on stateless JWT, RBAC, and resilient security patterns.**

A robust authentication service demonstrating advanced AppSec patterns, including **stateless JWT authentication**, **refresh token rotation with reuse detection**, **IP-based rate limiting** (Bucket4j), and **database-backed Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. It's engineered to prevent common vulnerabilities like broken authentication and brute-force attacks.
