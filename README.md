👋 Hello, I'm David Moura

**Software Engineer (Backend) | Java & Spring Boot | Application Security**

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software engineer focused on building **backend systems with security in mind**.  
My work revolves around **Java and Spring Boot**, where I design **RESTful APIs** with attention to clean architecture, maintainability, and **secure-by-design principles**.

I'm particularly interested in **Application Security (AppSec)** and in understanding how vulnerabilities arise in real-world systems — from authentication and authorization flaws to insecure configurations and unsafe defaults.

I approach software development as an **engineering discipline**, where clarity, correctness, and system behavior matter more than trends or tools alone.
